 **Running the Tests**
To verify that the script functions correctly, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have a sample dataset (CSV file) containing video game sales data.
2. Modify the script to read from the dataset if necessary.
3. Execute the script using the following command:
   ```sh
   python video_game_sales_analysis.py
   ```
4. Validate the output to ensure:
   - The dataset is loaded correctly.
   - The filtering criteria (games released after 2005) work as expected.
   - No errors occur during execution.

## Deployment
To use this script in a production environment:
- Ensure the dataset is securely stored and accessible.
- Optimize data processing if handling large datasets.
- Consider automating the script execution if frequent updates are required.
